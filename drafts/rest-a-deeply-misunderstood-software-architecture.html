                <p>A few weeks ago, I gave a talk at the Berlin Software Architecture
MeetUp group, with a title similar to the one I'm giving this
post. The slides are published, but they are really presentation
material (I don't like pasting lots of text on every slide) so they
are far from telling the whole story. In a series of posts starting
with this one, I will try to tell that story, and to complement it
with additional material and ideas.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-everyday-experience-of-rest">
<h2>The everyday experience of REST</h2>
<p>REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer, which, apart from
being a mouthful, is far from telling us what the thing is all
about. Most people have heard of REST in the context of service APIs
on the modern Internet: cool startups and established companies alike,
keep touting the fact that their products feature a &quot;convenient REST
API.</p>
<p>What they mean exactly by that is often far from clear. Typically, it
means that you will use HTTP to access the API, that the20 documentation
will contain instructions for you to build URLs, and that you will
call these URLs often using unusual HTTP methods such as PUT and
DELETE.</p>
<p>This is, however, far from the actual definition of REST (and yes,
there is a definition!). REST was defined by a guy who undoubtly
belongs to the founders of the World Wide Web: Roy Fielding. In
his doctoral dissertation, published in year 2000, Fielding defined
the REST architectural style based on his and other people's
experience building the World Wide Web. Basically, his idea was to
distill the aspects of the Web that make it so enormously scalable and
resilient into an abstract architectural style that could be applied
to other types of applications.</p>
<p>The interesting part is that, as common or popular as the REST/RESTful
denomination might be, very few of the industrial APIs that proudly
advertise themselves as being REST actually fit Fielding's
definition. This is, of course, not a crime (if a misrepresentation
of terms) and in fact, embracing only some of the REST constraints or
none at all can be the best option for many systems.</p>
<p>However, as I said before, REST is an abstraction of the WWW itself,
and, as such, is intended to make systems that are potentially as
scalable, resilient, and evolvable as the Web itself. What I'll try to
do in this and the following posts is to show you what these many
not-so-RESTful industrial APIs are missing, what it really takes to
build a RESTful system/API (hint “hypermedia” is the keyword here) and
why this can result in APIs that are more extensible, evolvable, and
scalable than most current HTTP-based APIs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-rest-maturity-model">
<h2>The REST &quot;maturity model&quot;</h2>
<p>One useful way to look at current APIs, and to relate them to the real
(or, if you want, ideal) definition of REST is the so-called REST
Maturity Model proposed by Leonard Richardson and discussed in an
<a class="reference external" href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html">excellent blog post</a> by
Martin Fowler.</p>
<p>Here is an adaptation of the illustration depicting the model in
Fowler's post:</p>
<p>[Maturity model illustration]</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Level 0: Plain old RPC (Example: Amazon EC2 API, XML-RPC, SOAP)</li>
<li>Level 1: Resources</li>
<li>Level 2: HTTP verbs (Examples: Amazon S3, Google Calendar, many,
many, more)</li>
<li>Level 3: Hypermedia controls (The WWW!), new PayPal, Nike,
GitHub and others.)</li>
</ul>
<p>One important caveat is that the title &quot;Maturity Model&quot; is a bit
misleading, as it suggests that APIs (or generally, software systems)
fitting to any of the lower levels, are REST but somehow to a lesser
degree than APIs fitting the higher levels. In fact, only Level 3 in
this model corresponds to the actual definition of REST. The remaining
levels are still useful, though, because they often describe practical
systems and thus can be used to determine how close a real system is
to being really RESTful.</p>
<p>In the following sections (and blog posts) I will cover these levels
in some detail, including, where possible, examples based on real,
well-known APIs. I will rely on the progression of the maturity levels
to introduce the basic aspects comprising a REST API. Afterwards, I'll
go into more detail on Level 3 (real REST) including some examples to
illustrate the potential benefits of building APIs at this level.</p>
<p>But before getting there, let's start at the beginning: Maturity
level 0.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="level-0-plain-old-rpc">
<h2>Level 0: Plain old RPC</h2>
<p>At least the older programmers around must be familiar with
traditional Remote Procedure Call (RPC) systems, such as CORBA and
DCOM, and (later) Java RMI. These systems were all the rage in the
1990s, so it’s no surprise that people tried to mimic their operation
when they designed the first Web-based APIs in the late 90s and early
2000s.</p>
<p>For those who never heard of it, RPC is about calling procedures
through the network. Let's first take a look at a regular procedure
call:</p>
<p>[Procedure call illustration]</p>
<p>The main characteristic of procedure calls, as illustrated by the
diagram above, is that the calling program waits for the called
procedure to complete. Once the procedure call completes and the
return value has been transfered back to the caller, the caller
continues its execution.</p>
<p>Remote Procedure Call systems try to keep this type of behavior, with
the difference that the caller and the callee are two separate
processes connected through a network in a typical client/server
arrangement:</p>
<div class="figure">
<object data="/images/REST-Misunderstood_002-RPC.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
</object>
</div>
<p>For each remote procedure call, the caller sends a message with
the procedure name and parameters, the server receives it, runs the
procedure with the given parameters, and sends a message back to the
client with the procedure's return value.</p>
<p>Many Web-based APIs created in the early 2000s would only use the HTTP
protocol as a transport mechanism for remote procedure calls. Let me
show you an example that I find very illustrative, the Amazon Elastic
Computing Cloud (EC2) API:
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fdocs.aws.amazon.com%2FAWSEC2%2Flatest%2FAPIReference%2FQuery-Requests.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGLSfKD0P-mhS4GTAtXJNg3629DuA">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Query-Requests.html</a></p>
<pre class="code literal-block">

Content-type: application/json

</pre>
<p>As you may know, the EC2 API is the one you use to create, destroy and
administer virtual machines in Amazon's enormously popular cloud
computing service.  EC2 uses GET requests for everything. A single,
entry point URL is used for all requests, and both the operation name
and its parameters, including identifiers for all affected objects,
are passed as part of the query string. Although this is simple (and
convenient, this API can be called by entering the URLs into a
browser’s address bar) it mostly misses the point, and skips most of
the advantages, of the HTTP protocol, as we will soon see.</p>
